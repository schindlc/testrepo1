01 Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl.
02 Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next.
03 Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet.
04 Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Riding Hood.
04 One day her mother said to her:
05 "Come Little Red Riding Hood.
07 Take them to your grandmother.
